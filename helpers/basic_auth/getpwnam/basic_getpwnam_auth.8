.SH NAME
basic_getpwnam_auth - Local Users auth helper for Squid
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
basic_getpwnam_auth
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This helper allows Squid to authenticate any local user accounts
to validate the user name and password of Basic HTTP authentication.
.
Uses getpwnam() and getspnam() routines for authentication.
This has the following advantages over the NCSA module:
.
.BR Allows authentication of all known local users
.BR Allows authentication through nsswitch.conf
.BR can handle NIS(+) requests
.BR can handle LDAP request
.BR can handle PAM request

.SH NOTES
.
When used for authenticating to local UNIX shadow password databases
the program must be running as root or else it won't have sufficient
permissions to access the user password database. Such use of this
program is not recommended, but if you absolutely need to then make
the program setuid root
.RS
.P
.B chown root basic_getpwnam_auth
.BR
.B chmod u+s basic_getpwnam_auth
.RE
.P
Please note that in such configurations it is also strongly recommended
that the program is moved into a directory where normal users cannot
access it, as this mode of operation will allow any local user to
brute-force other users passwords. Also note the program has not been
fully audited and the author cannot be held responsible for any security
issues due to such installations.
