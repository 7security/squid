- Possible Spelling errors :)

- IPv6 support has yet to be TESTED in a real IPv6 environment, but the code is in place to read IPv6
        networkAddress fields, please attempt this in a TESTING environment first.  Please read the
	README file to contact me regarding IPv6 support development.

- There is a known issue regarding Novell's Client for Windows, that is mostly fixed by using
        version 4.91 SP3+, with the 'Auto-Reconnect' feature not re-populating the networkAddress
        field in eDirectory.

- I have also expereinced an issue related to using NetWare 6.5 (SP6 and lower?) and connection licsensing.
        It appears that whenever a server runs low on connection licsenes, that it SOMETIMES does
        NOT populate the networkAddress fields correctly.

- I *STRONGLY RECOMMEND* using the latest version of the Novell Client in all situations *BEFORE*
        seeking support!  You may also want to MAKE SURE your servers also have the latest service packs.

- Majority of Proxy Authentication issues can be resolved by having the users' REBOOT if their networkAddress
        is not correct, or using squid_auth_ldap as a fallback.  Check ConsoleOne, etc to verify thier
	networkAddress fields to troubleshoot.

- More PROBLEMS using the helper?  Check README for contact information.
