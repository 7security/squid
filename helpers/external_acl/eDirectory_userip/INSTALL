To install squid_edir_lookup, you need to do the following.

1- Unpack this tarball.
2- Port?
	(See PORTING, program was written under a SuSe Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2 +
	 Open Enterprise Server 2 SP1 environment)
3- Run 'make'.
4- Run 'make install'. (Or optionally copy 'squid_edir_iplookup' to somewhere.
5- Edit squid.conf with the following lines as an example:

# Setup External ACL Helper with parameters (if required)
external_acl_type IPUser ttl=1800 negative_ttl=30 children=10 %SRC /usr/sbin/squid_edir_iplookup

# Next line sets how long the credentials last before re-authentication is required.
auth_param basic credentialsttl 30 minutes

# Next lines are required, and the actual ACL's may be customized to suit your needs.
#	In this example, the 'Internet_Allowed' and 'Internet_Denied' are Groups that users may
#	be used to control internet access, which can also be stacked against other ACL's.
#	Use of the groups is NOT REQUIRED.
acl edirectory_users_allowed external IPUser Internet_Allowed
acl edirectory_users_denied external IPUser Internet_Denied

# Next lines are used to bind ACL's to what they actually do.  Remember that Squid's
#	Default is to ALLOW ALL.
http_access deny edirectory_users_denied
http_access allow edirectory_users_allowed
http_access deny all

6- START Squid.  With some luck, you should have a blind eDirectory authenticator,
	That is, without the Users' knowledge that there even *IS* a proxy server!
