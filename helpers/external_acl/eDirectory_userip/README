This program has been written in order to solve the problems associated with running the
Perl squid_ip_lookup.pl as a squid external helper that has been provided by various
sources, including Novell, Inc.

The limitations of the Perl script involved memory/cpu utilization, speed, and the lack
of eDirectory 8.8 support, and IPv6 support.

This program is being provided to the Squid Cache Developers as a donation of code to
help further develop Squid, and it's seamless integration with a Novell Open Enterprise Server
deployment.  Hopefully one day Novell will include updated versions of squid into their
mainstream OES releases, such as the 3.1.x code tree.

This program has been used in a STABLE PRODUCTION ENTERPRISE environment for months before
being released to the Squid Development team, but that does not mean that bugs do not exist.

If they do, please contact myself for right now.  chad.naugle@travimp.com.
