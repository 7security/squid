<sect>Notice
<p>
The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-3.2.0.0 for testing.

This new release is available for download from <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/"> or the <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Mirrors/http-mirrors.html" name="mirrors">.

While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.

We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/TroubleShooting#head-7067fc0034ce967e67911becaabb8c95a34d576d"> for how to submit a report with a stack trace.

<sect1>Changes since earlier releases of Squid-3.2
<p>
The 3.2 change history can be <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/changesets/" name="viewed here">.

<sect>Major new features since Squid-3.1
<p>Squid 3.2 represents a new feature release above 3.1.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>SMP scalability
	<item>Helper Multiplexer
	<item>Helper Name Changes
	<item>Multi-Lingual manuals
	<item>Solaris 10 pthreads Support (Experimental)
</itemize>

Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).

<sect1>SMP scalability
<p>The new "workers" squid.conf option can be used to launch multiple worker
   processes and utilize multiple CPU cores. The overall intent is to make
   multiple workers look like one to an outside observer, while providing
   knobs to customize each worker behavior if needed.

<p>By default, all worker processes are configured identically and do what a
   single Squid instance would have done. Squid.conf macro substitutions and
   conditionals (see below) can be used to customize individual worker
   configurations. In the paragraphs below, "can share" implies "will share by
   default".

<p>Workers can share HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, ICP, and HTCP listening addresses.
   Configuration related to ICP and HTCP clients must be adjusted to avoid
   source address conflicts: Modify the IP address and/or the port used for
   the protocol. Workers do not share DNS addresses by default because the OS
   assigns each worker a unique DNS port.

<p>Workers can share logs.

<p>Workers cannot share caches, for now. Cache_dir options must be adjusted to
   point each disk-caching worker to its own disk area. ICP and HTCP responses
   are based on the responding worker cache state. Overall, SMP Squid behaves
   as a Squid farm behind a load-balancer with no cache affinity awareness.
   This is perfect for non-caching Squids but inappropriate for Squids that
   must coordinate caching activities (in-between environments are in a gray
   area requiring case-by-case analysis).

<p>Cache manager and SNMP statistics are reported from a worker point of
   view, for now.

<p>Startup, reconfiguration, shutdown, and log rotation are handled as for a
   monolithic Squid. Abnormally terminated workers are restarted while
   other workers continue serving traffic.


<sect2>Squid.conf macros and conditionals
<p>Added support for process_name and process_number macros as well as simple
   if-statement conditionals in squid.conf. These features allow individual
   worker customization in SMP mode. For details, search for "Conditional
   configuration" and "SMP-Related Macros" sections in squid.conf.documented.


<sect1>Helper Multiplexer
<p>The helper multiplexer's purpose is to relieve some of the burden
   Squid has when dealing with slow helpers. It does so by acting as a
   middleman between squid and the actual helpers, talking to Squid via
   the multiplexed concurrent variant of the helper protocol and to the
   helpers via the non-concurrent variant.

<p>Helpers are started on demand, and in theory the muxer can handle up to
   1k helpers per instance. It's up to squid to decide how many helpers
   to start.

<p>The muxer knows nothing about the actual messages being passed around,
   and as such can't really (yet?) compensate for broken helpers.
   It is not yet able to manage dying helpers, but it will.

<p>To configure the multiplexer add its binary name (usually /usr/share/libexec/helper-mux.pl)
   in front of the name of whichever helper is being multiplexed. It takes the helper binary
   path and parameters as its own command parameters. The <em>concurrency</em> setting already
   existing in Squid is used to configure how many child helpers it may run.

<p>For example, a traditional configration is
   <verb>
	url_rewrite_program /your/redirector.sh
	url_rewrite_children 5
   </verb>
   the alternative multiplexer configuration is:
   <verb>
	url_rewrite_program /usr/share/libexec/helper-mux.pl /your/redirector.sh
	url_rewrite_children 1 concurrency=5
   </verb>

<p>Helpers which are already concurrent protocol enabled gain little benefit from the multiplexer
   on most systems. However on some systems where Squid spawning helpers causes excess memory usage
   the reduction in direct helper spawned by Squid can result in a great reduction in resource use.

<p>The helper can be controlled using various signals:
   <itemize>
	<item>SIGHUP: dump the state of all helpers to STDERR
   </itemize>

<sect1>Helper Name Changes

<p>To improve the understanding of what each helper does and where it should be used the helper binaries
   which are bundled with Squid have undergone a naming change in this release.

<p>Below is a list of the old helper names and what their names have changed to.
   For several helpers the directory name used in --enable-X-helpers configure option has also changed.

</itemize>


<sect1>Multi-Lingual manuals

<p>The man(8) and man(1) pages bundled with Squid are now provided online for all
   versions and beginning with 3.2 they are available in languages other than english.

<p>Details in <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/QualityOfService" name="The Squid wiki">

<p>3.1 began the Internationalization of Squid with the public facing error pages.
   This move begins the Localization of the internal administrator facing manuals.

	This is the historic behaviour of Squid before logging modules were introduced, and
	remains the default used when no module is selected.
	It is recommended to upgrade logging to the faster <em>daemon:</em> module.
	<p>New <em>daemon</em> module to send each log line as text data to a file I/O daemon handling the slow disk I/O.
